                                    Cinematography Club is a club I started during my sophomore year. Mrs. Leonard was kind enough to agree to be my advisor and helped me create the club. I started the Cinematography Club because I love movies and wanted to spend time enjoying great films with my peers and discussing them. Whether it was a fun movie that lifted everyone’s spirits during the school day or a cinematic masterpiece directed by visionaries like Wes Anderson or Christopher Nolan, the club was always a highlight of my week.

I will always look back on the Cinematography Club as an amazing escape from school and a place to simply enjoy films.

WISE was a club that Ms. Leonard asked if I would be interested in starting. She had been part of WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) when she was in college, and I thought it would be a great opportunity to bring girls together and create that kind of supportive community.

We’ve had some amazing opportunities to hear from women with diverse backgrounds in science and engineering, who shared their experiences and inspired us with their stories.

                                    My journey on the Web Design Advisory Board has been an incredible experience. I was honored to be given a leadership position in my first year in the program and have proudly held that role ever since. Throughout my time on the board, I always saw myself as an active and dedicated member, committed to supporting both administration and students. Being part of meaningful conversations and helping shape the direction of the program has been deeply rewarding. I am truly thankful for the experience and plan to return as an alumni member to continue offering my support.
